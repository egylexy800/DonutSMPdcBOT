Simple Discord bot that uses python!
If you want to use this, make sure to create a new file called apikeys.py,
and you will need to put this:


bot_token= "your-bot-token-here"


discord_welcome = Channel ID of your welcom channel here
discord_logs = Channel ID of your logs channel here


queue = []






banned_words = ["example1", "example2", "etc."]
